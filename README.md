# Urban Building Energy Modeling Tool (UBEM)

## Overview
**Arcade** is an Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) tool developed as an add-on extension for Blender. It leverages 3D visualization of building geometries and an AI-powered image detection module to extract key building features that are often unavailable, such as building height and construction age. Arcadeâ€™s primary purpose is to generate hourly heating and cooling demand data for urban areas, supporting the design and optimization of efficient district heating and cooling systems.

## Features
### Key Capabilities
- **3D Visualization**: Seamless integration with Blender for 3D visualization of buildings.
- **Energy Simulation**: Hourly heating and cooling demand calculation based on a simplified resistance-capacitor (5R1C) method.
- **Automatic building data enrichment**: 
  - AI-based: building attributes (height and construction age) estimated through IA-based image recognition techniques.
  - Probablisitic-based: building attributes (height and construction age) estimated using user-defined factors, such as average values and standard deviations

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Blender**: Version 4.3 or higher.



### Steps
Launch Blender and enable the UBEM add-on via **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
