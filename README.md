# Urban Building Energy Modeling Tool (UBEM)

## Overview
The **Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) Tool** is designed to simulate energy use and thermal behavior of buildings in urban areas. It enables researchers, urban planners, and policymakers to evaluate energy demand and assess the potential for energy efficiency measures at the city scale.

The tool integrates 3D visualization, probabilistic data modeling, and AI-based building feature extraction for accurate and scalable analysis.
