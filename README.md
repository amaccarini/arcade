# Urban Building Energy Modeling Tool (UBEM)

## Overview
**Arcade** is an Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) tool developed as an add-on extension for Blender. The tool integrates 3D visualization of building geometries and an AI-based image detection module for extraction of building key features tpyically unavaliable (i.e. building height and age of construction). . Arcadeâ€™s primary purpose is to generate hourly heating and cooling demand data for urban areas, supporting the design and development of efficient district heating and cooling systems.
