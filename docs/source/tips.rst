Tips
=====

- When Blender performs long computations, it typically becomes unresponsive. To monitor the progress of the calculations, open the system console before clicking the buttons to create the geoJSON file or calculate the loads. You can do this by navigating to **Window > Toggle System Console**. For MacOS users, we recommend to launch Blender following this `approach <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/command_line/launch/macos.html>`_.

- For additional information about the BRAILS Python module, please refer to its official `documentation <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/BRAILS-Documentation/>`_.
