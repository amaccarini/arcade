Navigate to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons** and search for Arcade. Expand the Arcade panel to access its preferences. You''ll need to configure a few preferences:

- **Output folder**: Select your preferred folder for storing output files (it’s recommended to choose a folder where you have write permissions). 
- **Weather file**: Locate the ``.epw`` file you plan to use for the energy simulations.
- **(Optional) Google API Key**: If you intend to use BRAILS, you will need to provide a valid Google API key in string format.

Once Arcade is installed and the preferences are configured, you’re ready to get started!
