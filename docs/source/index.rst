Welcome to Arcade's documentation!
===================================

**Arcade** is a free and open-source Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM) tool developed as a Python add-on extension for Blender. It leverages 3D visualization of building geometries and an AI-powered image recognition module to extract key building attributes that are often unavailable, such as building height and construction age. Arcadeâ€™s primary purpose is to generate hourly heating and cooling demand data of urban areas in just a few clicks, supporting the design and optimization of efficient district heating and cooling systems.
